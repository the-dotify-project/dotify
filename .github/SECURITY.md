# Security Policy

If you believe you have identified a security issue, **do not open a public issue**. To  report a security issue, please contact billsioros97@gmail.com.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with
reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the
maintainers address the issue faster. If you are willing, you may also
include a fix for the issue generated with `git format-patch`. You may
include a name and link, if you would like to be credited for the report.

After fixing the issue, we will make a security release along with an
announcement on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/the-dotify-project/dotify/discussions).
